" Function to work around the problem of vim-workspace
" having trouble loading NvimTree buffers, which would
" require to remember closing all NvimTree buffers
" before quitting the session
"
" This function checks if there's any NvimTree buffers open,
" closes them, and then saves the workspce and writes to all
" buffers. If quit_after is set to 1, quits all buffers too
